      <title>Happy Birthday!</title>
      <description>It's been five years already!&#13;
So much has changed around here in that time and what started as a little page with a mere 21 strategies is now the central hub for WoW pet battling strategies, hosting over 5000 strategies, with almost 15k registered users. Couldn't be more proud, thank you for making this an amazing community :-)&#13;

      <title>Children's Week</title>
      <description>[i][b]Youâre not quite sure how you got roped into this, but through the haze of last nightâs drinking of a particularly heady Pandaren brew, you recall a card game. In fact, as the bits and pieces slowly fall into place while you eat your breakfast, you remember someone unexpected and out of place at the card table: a matronly woman. After being thoroughly trounced, you pushed the winnings toward her. &#13;
&#13;
She smiled, and took only half. âYouâll need the rest for tomorrow,â she said,  [...]</description>

A little girl skips by you, dressed in her finest spring garb, singing the familiar rhyme. Her wicker basket is full of brightly colored eggs and it swings in time with the words, as her mother hurries to catch up.&#13;

As you walk the path, heading back to where your journey began, the signs of spring are all around you: flowers blooming, earth being made ready for sowing, and the warmth of the sun before it becomes scorching summer  [...]</description>

      <title>Datamined Potential Pet Models</title>
      <description>We're back, and with some potential pet models we might be seeing in the next expansion!&#13;
&#13;
[b]The models below were chosen based on three factors:[/b]&#13;
&#13;
1. They're similar to a model that has come up in the alpha pet filters (Foxes)&#13;
&#13;
2. They're similar or re-skins of models found in the live version of the game.&#13;
&#13;
3. Candidates for potential new models that looked way too cool to leave off the list.&#13;

      <title>Cataclysm Timewalking</title>
      <description>We must now go back to a time when the very land itself cries out in agony, as the one meant to watch over the earth and deep places of the world rends our home. Deathwing wrought a terrible change upon Azeroth, and those of the Infinite Dragonflight seek to break the timeline, just as the former Earth-Warder sought to do the same to our kingdoms. This is where you come in, champion. Preserve the timeline, defeat the Infinite Dragonflight, and maybe pick up a few pets along the  [...]</description>

      <title>Where on Azeroth is Jenafur?</title>
      <description>In one of the longest-running secrets of WoW, Jenafur is still eluding the Secret Finders among us. However, yesterday there was another clue, Scooby Doos:&#13;

[qt]kibbles of 4, sets the time, of a 4/4 beat, and defines the lines[/qt]&#13;
&#13;
I can say I have no idea what any of that means, but it's my sincere hope that it inspires someone on the Discord.&#13;

It joins this clue given on 8 January 20:&#13;

      <description>A chill creeps through the timestream, and the howling of the undead scourge echos through the Caverns of Time. The Bronze dragons have once again called upon the heroes of Azeroth to battle the Infinite Dragonflight, and help preserve the timeline. This time we're being sent to Northrend, to battle the forces and allies of the Lich King. Though there aren't any pets to be found from the WotLK Timewalking dungeons, or the Timewalking Vendor -- Auzin -- there are some pets that can drop during  [...]</description>

[user=6842] brought up the idea to highlight pet related videos from and for the community, and here they are! &#13;

It's super fresh so we're still experimenting a little but so far it looks neat.&#13;

      <title>Burning Crusade Timewalking</title>
      <description>The Bronze Dragonflight is once again calling on the heroes of Azeroth to help repair the timestreams, and prevent catastrophic changes from happening. Of course, that doesnât mean we canât collect a few pets along the way!&#13;

It may not seem obvious at a glance, but the Burning Crusade timewalking vendor does sell pets, or rather the chance for pets to drop. When you visit Cupri in the middle of Shattrath on the second floor of the Terrace of Light, youâll see she has Bag of Fishing  [...]</description>

Hearts of pink, red, and white litter every possible surface of the buildings, and a not so subtle aroma clings to the air with a persistence that leaves you lightheaded. Coy glances and breathy laughter follow you through the city as you go about your errands, while you try not to think too hard about what force in nature decided it was a good idea to give a goblin wings, and the power to bestow love on unsuspecting passerby.

      <title>Mists of Pandaria Timewalking</title>
      <description>The timeline is once more in danger, and the Bronze Dragonflight has called upon the heroes of Azeroth to venture into the swirling mists of Pandaria. Perhaps we'll also find a few pets hiding amidst the timeways?&#13;

This week's timewalking vendor offers two pets: the Paradox Spirit &amp; the Infinite Hatchling, and they both cost 2200 Timewarped Badges.&#13;

      <title>Feast of Winter Veil</title>

While in the capital doing some last-minute shopping, laughter and cheering catches your attention. You turn to find a cadre of people hauling in the giant Winter Veil tree, as children skip and  [...]</description>

      <description>Just when we thought Blizzard was done adding new pets to the PTR, the latest build has brought a new surprise: meet the Shadowbarb Hatchling!&#13;

This pet is a reward as part of a quest chain, combined with hatching it through a progression of daily quests. These dailies and quests are attached to the Assaults, needing specific ones to be up depending on where you are in the chain. The dailies will reward 300 xp, and the unique quests will give 900 xp. &#13;

      <description>It seems as though a new pet dungeon isn't all we'll be getting in 8.3--we'll be getting some new WQs in the corrupted zones, too!&#13;
&#13;
There's four different battles per zone, against single enemy pets, who are Legendary quality with the Elite Buff, (Reduces Damage by 50%).&#13;
&#13;
The new WQs have been added in the BFA &gt; BfA World Quests tab on the site! &#13;

      <description>Yesterday, the PTR was taken down for a wipe, as well as a new build. And guess what? We finally have access to the new pet dungeon: Blackrock Depths! There were also updates to pets weâd previously seen, as well as some new ones joining the pet journal. &#13;

In this post, weâll be showing you all the pet updates, and once weâve made it through the pet dungeon, that will be its own post. Let me tell you: the new dungeon is a doozy. &#13;

The aroma of freshly baked bread makes your mouth water, as you pull the skull-shaped loaf from your pack, and then place it gingerly next to the candle. &#13;

      <title>8.3 PTR Update ~~ 16 October 2019</title>
      <description>Those who tried to log in to the PTR today found the servers down, which could only mean one thing: more content! Along with a scad of datamined class changes, auction house tweaks, boss model updates, and much more, we were greeted by some new pets. Iâm happy to report that we will be awash in void, tentacles, and eyeballs, with some lovely new models and abilities! &#13;
&#13;
This content update fleshed out some drops weâll see in three different areas: Corrupted Zones, Horrific Visions, and the  [...]</description>

      <title>New Landing Page</title>
      <description>Long in the works, a brand new landing page makes it to Xu-Fu. Exactly the one you are reading on right now :-)&#13;
&#13;
It brings a few new things: a fresh design, a lot more readability thanks to better formatting options, and the biggest change, [user=2434] is adding News about the Pet Battling world from now on! &#13;
Even more reason to stop by regularly :-)</description>

      <title>Patch 8.3 PTR &amp; Conclusion to the Shadowy Figures?</title>
      <description>On October 7th, Blizzard announced patch 8.3, the latest content update to Battle for Azeroth. Not only will we be battling an Old God, but weâll also find out what those Shadowy Figures lurking in our pet dungeons have been up to!&#13;

      <title>Strategy Creation Rules</title>
      <description>The possibility for all registered users to upload their own strategies was extremely successful. Since then, Xu-Fu has grown immensely thanks to everyone who contributes. On a much smaller scale, however, we saw a number of strategies that were not up to the standards we set out. When I created Xu-Fu's Pet Guides, my goal was simply to provide my own strategies. That later turned into providing the best strategies for each fight and a good variety for all different levels of battlers.&#13;

      <description>I have some great news to share, and no, it's not WoW Classic related, sorry. It is, however, related to someone you have stumbled upon almost guaranteed if you've been using Xu-Fu to look up strategies in the last few months. So pretty much everyone who will read this.

      <title>Patch 8.2 and Pet Update Issues</title>
      <description>The patch is live and with it the usual suspects - API problems ^^&#13;
&#13;
Importing or updating your pet collection from the armory currently returns zero pets. This is an issue on Blizzards side and we'll need to wait until it's been addressed.&#13;
In the meanwhile, it's the perfect opportunity to build some better error messages in so you know what's going on when trying to update your collection :-)</description>

      <description>In the last weeks, Xu-Fu got a lot of additional help, both from veteran Xu-Fu collaborators and new people. Most of the work has been put into guides and they are definitely worth a shout-out here. &#13;

The recent maintenance paved the way for some big changes on Xu-Fuâs Pet Guides. If you joined us on Discord, you will have seen the beginnings of it already. Now itâs time to unveil the big news: Xu-Fu is going to transform from a page dedicated solely to providing the best strategies, to becoming the best pet trading platform on this planet!&#13;

      <description>Activity has picked up on Xu-Fu and Iâm really excited to introduce you to the latest addition in pet collection tools: The Pet Moocher! Not an April fools joke, itâs a real thing!&#13;
Ever wanted to compare your collection to someone else for any duplicate, cageable pets you can trade between each other? Or maybe just be selfish and see which ones you could mooch from someone else? That doesnât have to be a tedious task with lists and formulas, enter the Pet Moocher! &#13;

&#13;
But there is another thing thatâs overdue to mention:&#13;
For a couple of weeks now, Xu-Fu has seen some immense improvements. Most notably in loading times, which are reduced drastically, but there have been changes in the background in most areas that make the page faster, more flexible and more secure. All of that is thanks to [user=6302]!&#13;

      <description>When Legion was released, I struggled very hard to keep up with the world quests and test+add strategies. Now with BfA, since everyone can upload strategies, every one of the new quests has a number of different alternatives available already. &#13;

It worked out very well, all thanks to you, the creators of all those strategies out there. [b]A BIG THANK YOU![/b]&#13;

      <description>The release of a new addon is always a very special time. All that anticipation, culminating into the first hours of entering new zones and experiencing all the new content that we only read about or maybe saw some videos. Or played on the beta, but it's not the same right?&#13;
&#13;
All that is going to happen in just one hour. For that, Xu-Fu and I wish you an amazing start into this new expansion. Let everything else be aside for a while, embrace the experience, and enjoy it!</description>

      <title>Battle for Azeroth - Pre-Patch Preparations</title>
      <description>One month to go for Battle for Azeroth, and this week the pre-patch will hit already! With so many changes coming in that patch, a blog entry about it is long overdue.&#13;
&#13;
1. Use your pet charms today!&#13;
Pet Charms as we know it will lose in their value immensely. With the pre-patch comes a new currency and you won't be able to buy upgrading stones with the old charms anymore. So if you still need some or want to stockpile, spend them today!&#13;

This one went much smoother than I expected, and I'm super happy about it. It is feature 2 of 3 core things I need to complete before Battle for Azeroth hits the shelves. That gives me another 6 weeks from now to finish up and have Xu-Fu ready for the next addon. Yay!&#13;

Rosqo, well known in the pvp world of pet battles, volunteered to work on this section and will fill it with life. He is creating many pet related videos on Youtube to share his team setups and the thoughts behind them. &#13;

The Battle Tables desperately needed an overhaul. They are the core part of the page, and yet they were old and dusty. Not any more! It's all fixed, brought up to modern standard, loads much faster and most importantly a ton of new features:&#13;

There is a lot happening. Not so much in the pet battling world - Battle for Azeroth is still rather light on pet battling content, I've been told. But in Aranesh's "other" life (besides taking care of little Xu-Fu) things are pretty much in turmoil. And of course, everything happens pretty much at the same time.

&#13;
An until today unrevealed team of IT scientists working for Xu-Fu has analysed thousands of strategies from pet battlers all over the world and done the impossible: they created [b]FO-01[/b], an artificial intelligence that can create new pet battling strategies better than any human being!&#13;

In the middle of working on the battle tables, I needed a bit of a break and decided to add a different some stuff that makes it easier for all my helpers: An article editor! It's almost done, and I've used it now to add a new little section: My development notes :D&#13;
&#13;
You'll find them by hovering over "News" and selecting, surprise, "Development Notes".&#13;

      <description>Today I have a small update on the current development of wow-petguide.com. &#13;

Displaying strategies is certainly the key aspect of the page. Yet all new features of the last year were accessories to that. Cool ones, like the collection viewer, but not hitting the core element that brings battlers to visit Xu-Fu on a daily basis.&#13;

That is changing with the next update, because I am working on one of the - in my opinion - coolest features for Xu-Fu so far: a complete revamp of the Battle  [...]</description>

      <title>A new year, a small update... and Discord!</title>
      <description>Today is the last day of 2017 and oh boy, what a year it has been! So much new content for us pet battlers. We saw the first pet battle dungeons with the [url=https://wow-petguide.com/index.php?m=WailingCritters]Wailing Caverns[/url] and [url=https://wow-petguide.com/index.php?m=Deadmines]Deadmines[/url], dozens of new pets throughout the year, and a whole new set of family challenges with the legendary pets of Argus! &#13;

      <description>For a short time only - since November - it is possible to register an account with Xu-Fu. And now, less than two months later, a first milestone is reached: please join me in congratulating [user=1000] for being user number 1000!&#13;
&#13;
It happened much faster than I expected. Actually, I was expecting a lot more problems along the way, but everything seems to work really smoothly :-)&#13;

All that work with user accounts and your collection being saved has to lead towards something, doesn't it?&#13;
The first step of that something just went live! &#13;
&#13;
If you go to any of the main categories you will find that the pet table got a big makeover. It loads a lot faster, checks for required pets with much higher accuracy and gives you more info.&#13;
And if you are also logged in with your pet collection saved, you will see that the table automatically checks if you have the  [...]</description>

      <title>Xu-Fu goes RSS Feed!</title>
      <description>My last update took a very long time to complete, because most of the features were interlinked with each other. I could not publish any of them without the others being in place. Now that the user system is up and running, I can easily add things on top and also have the time again to work on some smaller, fun things.&#13;
&#13;
For a start, I implemented the suggestion of [user=14] to add an RSS feed for the news! &#13;

&#13;
I always wanted to add a user account system but in order to do so I had to learn many new things.&#13;
It should be easy to use, with enough features in it, but also well encrypted and secured. All of this took a lot of time, but I'm very proud to announce that Xu-Fu accounts are now live!&#13;

Check out the [i][b]Login[/b][/i] button on the top right. I recommend creating an account using your Battle.net account. That way you won't need an additional password and will be logged in  [...]</description>

      <description>The last weeks were super relaxing. I saw and learned a lot of new things and spent equally as much time chilling on a beach :D&#13;
Now it's time to put that restored energy to some good use!&#13;
&#13;
But first of all another big thank you for putting together all your insights and ideas for Family Fighter. In those two weeks, more than 3000 comments were submitted! Because of the sheer number of comments, it's the first time I won't manage to read all of them. I'm sorry for any great idea hidden in  [...]</description>

      <description>Argus sure kept us on our toes, but thanks to the many suggestions and comments, all Family Fighter combinations now have strategies!&#13;
Not all of them are perfect, and some amazing ideas are probably still hidden in the sheer mass of suggestions sent in.&#13;
But slowly and steadily, we are going through them and adding more to the page. I want to say a big thank you to [user=4320], [user=1225], [user=39] and [user=4] in particular, who are actively working on the strategies besides me: your help  [...]</description>

And Xu-Fu is an especially happy little cat right now! Thanks to the immense help of [user=4320] and [user=5712] we were able to provide strategies for most of the Anomalous Animals right from patch release! &#13;

With the new fights came an incredible increase in activity here. It's absolutely overwhelming and I want to thank you all for trying the fights, sending in suggestions and commenting about your findings. Truth is, there are more comments  [...]</description>

      <description>Yesterdays announcement at Gamescom in Cologne came as a surprise. Patch 7.3 and with it the new Argus zones is going live next week already, on 29/30th of August!&#13;
&#13;
Well, I can say without a doubt that Illidan was right this time with his favorite quote: Xu-Fu certainly is not fully prepared, yet! &#13;

      <title>TD Battle Pet Script</title>
      <description>Today I would like to introduce a small but powerful new addition to Xu-Fu's guides: Scripts for TD BattlePetScript.&#13;
&#13;
A little introduction first: tdBattlePetScript is a fantastic addon created by [url=https://wow.curseforge.com/members/ldz5n]ldz5[/url] for speeding up PVE pet battles, and removing the element of human error from repetitive battles.&#13;
With it you can create scripts for specific pet battle teams, which will allow you to run the fight by pressing a single hotkey each round.  [...]</description>

In the last year, pet battles saw an immense amount of content, and wow-petguide.com a surge of activity with it! It has been an amazing ride so far and I can only guess what's still to come.

Now they also found their own, separated space in the form of their own category :-)&#13;
If you are on the Falcosaur quest chain you will ultimetely end up with their individual pet battle quest challenges, and the more than 150 different strategies listed [url=https://www.wow-petguide.com/index.php?m=Falcosaur]here[/url] will hopefully make it a breeze for  [...]</description>

There are many new things coming with this major update patch. I highly recommend checking out a summary from one of the big WoW news pages.&#13;
In terms of pet battles, a good number of new pets are coming, but also new world quest tamers and a whole new pet battle dungeon.&#13;

      <title>Wailing Critters Guides</title>
      <description>Hi!&#13;
The Wailing Critters pet battle dungeon is still the biggest pet addition coming in 7.2&#13;
I am preparing my personal guide for the challenge mode, but due to the nature of it I am looking for people interested in providing their own guide.&#13;
&#13;
Why? Well, the pet dungeon is a different kind of challenge. You can't heal or revive pets, okay, but the fights are also not extremely hard like in the Celestial Tournament. There is a huge variety of pets that can beat the individual enemies, but  [...]</description>

      <title>Patch 6.2 Pet Madness!</title>
      <description>The upcoming patch 6.2 will not only introduce the Tanaan Jungle as a new zone, but will also add a huge amount of pet battle opportunities. Currently Draenor does not offer many dailies and this patch appears to address this.&#13;
&#13;
Similar to the Beasts of Fable, you will face legendary pets spread throughout the Tanaan Jungle. Luckily you won't have to chase them down since they will stay in place, like the legendary beasts in Pandaria.&#13;
&#13;
However they will pose a different challenge in that  [...]</description>

In terms of pet battles nothing has changed, you will still find the two usual dailies available. &#13;
I posted strategies that you can use to also level pets up and that don't use any exotic or rare pets. &#13;

      <description>Welcome to Xu-Fu's Pet Battle Guides!&#13;
&#13;
Today marks the start of this little project.&#13;
&#13;
For a long time I have been doing my daily battles, leveling my pets and trying myself on new challenges. I tried different ways to memorize all the strategies I use. But with more and more fights, nothing felt convenient enough in quickly providing access to the information I needed: what pets, what spells and what rotation to use.&#13;
&#13;
And thus the first version of my own pet guides started, as an online  [...]</description>
