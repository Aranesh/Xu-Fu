msgid "Thank you for signing up with Xu-Fu's Pet Guides!<br><br>There are many new options available to you now, most of which you can find in your account area right here.<br>I suggest going to your Pet Collection first to make sure your pet library has been imported correctly. This will power a lot of the more advanced features here!<br><br>If you go to My Profile, you can select what other battlers see when clicking on your profile. Maybe leave them a little introduction about yourself? Or just turn off all areas if you prefer a bit more privacy.<br><br>You might also want to check out the Settings. There you can not only change your profile picture but also find options for your saved email, password or preferred language.<br><br>I hope you have a pleasant stay here and wish you all the best in your battles!<br><br>Yours,<br>Xu-Fu"

Dadurch werden viele der wirklich mächtigen Funktionen der Seite erst verfügbar.<br><br>Wenn Du auf dein Profil schaust, kannst du einstellen, was andere Nutzer über dich sehen. Schreib vielleicht eine kleine Biographie? Oder, falls dir Privatsphäre wichtiger ist, schalt einfach alles an Sichtbarkeit aus.<br><br>In den Einstellungen kannst Du noch einige weitere Dinge des Accounts einstellen wie eine E-Mail hinterlegen (wir schicken keinerlei Werbung oder Newsletter. Die E-Mail ist nur für den Fall, dass Du dein Passwort vergisst) oder ein paar andere Präferenzen für den Besuch der Seite.<br><br>Hab einen schönen Aufenthalt hier und viel Erfolg bei Deinen Haustierkämpfen!<br><br>Dein Xu-Fu"
