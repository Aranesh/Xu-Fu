This will power a lot of the more advanced features here!<br><br>If you go to My Profile, you can select what other battlers see when clicking on your profile. Maybe leave them a little introduction about yourself? Or just turn off all areas if you prefer a bit more privacy.<br><br>You might also want to check out the Settings. There you can not only change your profile picture but also find options for your saved email, password or preferred language.<br><br>I hope you have a pleasant stay here and wish you all the best in your battles!<br><br>Yours,<br>Xu-Fu"
